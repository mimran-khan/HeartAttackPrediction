# Heart Disease Prediction - Problem Statement

## Overview
Heart disease is recognized as the leading cause of death in the developed world. The objective of this project is to employ a dataset for predicting the likelihood of patients suffering from heart disease in the near future based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this prediction is available [here](https://github.com/mimran-khan/HeartAttackPrediction/blob/main/heart.csv).

## Instructions
### 1. Import Libraries/Dataset
  - **Dataset Download**
  - **Libraries Importation**

### 2. Data Visualization and Exploration
  - **Initial Data Check**: Two rows are to be printed for a sanity check to identify all features present in the dataset and their alignment with the target.
  - **Class Imbalance Analysis**: The class imbalance is to be commented on with an appropriate visualization method.
  - **Dataset Insights**: Appropriate visualizations are to be provided to gain insights about the dataset.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: A correlational analysis on the dataset is to be performed with a visualization provided. The impact of this analysis on feature selection is to be discussed.

### 3. Data Pre-processing and Cleaning
  - **Pre-processing Steps**: NULL or Missing Values are to be identified if any, outliers handled if present in the dataset, and skewed data addressed. The pre-processing steps performed are to be mentioned with justification.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Appropriate feature engineering techniques are to be applied. Transformations such as Standardization, Normalization, etc., are to be used depending on the dataset's structure and complexity. The techniques used must be justified.

### 4. Model Building
  - **Dataset Splitting**: The dataset is to be split into training and test sets. The choice of split must be justified.
  - **Model Development**: Models such as Random Forest and KNN are to be used. The best parameters are to be identified and justified.

### 5. Performance Evaluation
  - **Predictions**: Predictions on the test data are to be made and the results displayed.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**: All evaluation metrics are to be calculated and the best metric chosen for the model must be justified.
  - **Model Comparison**: The models are to be compared in a tabulated form. Comparisons must be justified.
